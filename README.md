## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

    Add their email and submit the form
    See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
    See form validation messages if:
        The field is left empty
        The email address is not formatted correctly
    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.

## ðŸ’¡Ideas to test yourself


1. Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus
2. Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
3. Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is essential for professional developers

## Luke's notes
I'll run the clock as I'm working on this project.
Just started the clock now.

The estimating idea above - seems very valuable. At this stage it really is a guess.
I'm going to say 18 hours to be conservative. It may be much less, but it may take longer. This includes deployment to github pages.
There are 6 steps they've got in the existing readme. I'm giving myself what seems like a generous 3 hours per step.

## Step 1. Initialise public repo on GitHub for the project.
>> I got thie done. 8:09 am.
Read the suggested gitHub docs at
- https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories
- https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
That's quickstart for repositories and cloning a repository.
I've also init ed git on the project.

## Step 2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
>> I'll try git hub pages for this. I have set up one of these ages ago, but will now review.
See how far I get in the next 13 mins.
(also need to publish my local changes back to gitHub.)
Pushed local readme to gitHub.

8:31 am 
35 minutes up. Still need to learn how to publish a GitHub page.
I have one, but creating new ones for projects with unique URLs..
How is this done? Will google next time.

Watched a vid on setting up a github page.
Set up the github page. Took <15 mins.
Live URL is now at:
